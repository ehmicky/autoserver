Run `npm install`.

# Build tasks

You can run the following tasks on the command line:
  - `gulp`: build and run an example HTTP server at `http://localhost:5001`
    in watch mode.
    The server's configuration is available at `/examples`.
  - `gulp build`: build the application
  - `gulp test`: test and lint the application
  - `gulp buildwatch`, `gulp testwatch`: like `gulp build` and `gulp test` but
    in watch mode

For more information on the available tasks, run `gulp --tasks`.
